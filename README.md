## Technical Overview

1. **React Foundations**: This application is constructed using fundamental React concepts, from component lifecycle methods to state and props management.
2. **Local Persistence**: Incorporated local storage to simulate real-world applications where data persistence across sessions is critical.
3. **Component Architecture**: The app is designed using a modular component approach. Key components include App, Header, Tasks, AddTask, Button, and others.
4. **Interactive UI**: Besides the functional aspects, the application also emphasizes the user interface, providing dynamic feedback to user interactions.
5. **Environment with Vite**: Leveraged Vite for a more efficient and streamlined development environment.
